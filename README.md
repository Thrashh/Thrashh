Heyo! Im Thrash! You may also know me as okaa.

I dont really do a lot of collabs so there is no point in asking.

Currently working on:
A Minecraft cheat client (Private).
And a mod menu for Gorilla Tag (Highly Private). (in dev since feb 2022)

I dont really code a lot, I know a little bit of c#, skript, and java.
Thats all for now though. See ya!
